# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
A DevOps practice where infrastructure is managed/provisioned through code and config files, rather than manual processes.
- Automates the creation of environments like networks, VMs, databases

Makes deployment faster, more consistent, repeatable.


## Terraform
IaC tools can be classified as:
- **Configuration orchestration (Terraform)**: provisioning of cloud resources
- **Configuration management (Ansible)**: maintaining a desired state in already-provisioned resources

Terraform uses **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language) - this allows engineers to describe what they want ("desired state" - this is **declarative logic**) **rather than writing imperative logic on how to do it**.



5. Examples of companies/industries that are using Terraform?
6. How does Terraform connect/communicate with AWS?
