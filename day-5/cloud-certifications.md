# Cloud certification guidance
Of the big three cloud providers, it only recommended to get certifications for one. The skills are mostly transferable.

I would also recommend paying for a training course (on Udemy or similar) as although you know much of what you need, small details like names of services, certain scenarios etc. needs to be learned in a more traditional way before you attempt the exam.
