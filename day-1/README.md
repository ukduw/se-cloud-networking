VPCs are IaaS.

### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
Range of available IP Adresses, described by wideness. The VPC's CIDR block must be the widest, so the CIDR blocks of any subnets can be within them.

CIDR blocks are denoted by IPs, e.g.
- 10.0.0.0/16
- The digits are denoted by 8, 16, 24, 32
