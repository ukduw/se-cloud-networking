# Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)
Set of DevOps practices **automating the software delivery process**
- From code changes to deployment
- Allows for **faster, more frequent, more reliable software releases** via...
- **Automated builds, tests, deployments**

**CI focuses on merging code often, while CD handles releasing that tested code...**
- **Manually (Delivery)**
- Or, **automatically (Deployment)**

CI/CD means:
- Faster releases
- More frequent testing (so typically less bugs)
- Better collaboration and fast feedback loops
- Reduced risk due to smaller, more frequent changes (as opposed to large, infrequent changes)


### Continuous Integration (CI)
In practice, this means **developers merge code changes into main repo frequently**
- **Each merge triggers an automated build and test sequence**
    - Allows for quick fixes and a stable codebase

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
This is the **automation of the release of built and tested code**
- Automation means the **code is always in a deployable, production-ready state**
    - The final deployment to production may still require a manual approval

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
A step further than Delivery, this **automates the Deployment of every change that passes all stages of the pipeline to production**.
    - Release happens automatically
    - **Maximizes speed and efficiency** in getting newly developed features/fixes to users
